# Project Overview
This engraving system was created to fill in the gap left by CAM systems inability to create dynamic engravings, and the difficulty of making nice looking engravings without using a CAM system. This engraving program is incredibly versatile, it was designed to be easy to use for both simple and complex engravings, while at the same time allowing for extreme control on positioning and output. This system will allow you to easily program engravings that tightly follow contours, edges, and fit neatly between different part features all without a requiring complicated CAM software. Furthermore, this system allows complete control of the engraving text and changes to the positioning directly from the machine controller. While a CAM system can directly program engravings, they lack one feature that this system does easily and very well; serial numbers, sequential letters, and the ability to have dynamically changing engravings. With a creative programmer this system has very few limitations and dozens of customizable features and options to fine tune every aspect of how the text is engraved. This system will produce smooth engravings with true arcs that were designed and handcrafted specifically for this application, complete with over 60 characters.

## Future and Reporting Bugs
Version 1.0 currently doesnâ€™t support a robust date and time detail. This will be added in a future update.

If you find issues in the code, you can submit a bug report on the GitHub page by creating a new issue. You can also email me directly at steinjj9@yahoo.com. This system was created purely as a project of passion and I make no guarantees on future updates.
