(This Example is for a detail block that is embedded into the main program)
(Everything between VVVVV and ^^^^ is machine code, anything in () is an explaination)



(These lines MUST be run before anything else in your program and must be placed at the top)
(#1 is set by the the shape program, variable C, that makes it branch to the detail block.)
(By having K set to 123 we can jump the program to N123 to read the detail block on that line)
(If there are multiple detail blocks you can put them in series like this it is here)
(It would also be good practice to have any operator changed variables like job numbers here aswell.)
(vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv)
IF [ #1 EQ 123 ] GOTO123
IF [ #1 EQ 124 ] GOTO124
#102= 1. (SERIAL NUMBER, ONLY NEED TO SET FOR FIRST PART!)
(SERIAL NUMBER WILL INCREMENT ON ITS OWN AFTERWARDS)
#100= 16393. (JOB NUMBER) 
#101= 1. (JOB LETTER, A=1, B=2..)
(^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^)





(Your main machining program would go here, do not put any machine move before the above section)
(If you do, the engraving program will execute any Gcode that is placed before the If[]Goto lines!)






(This is the code that will machine the engraving on your part. The subprogram is mostly self contained.)
(The subprogram will use the tool offset for whatever tool is currently in the spindle and it will use)
(the work offset that is currently active when it is executed. In this example B is set to 1. because that)
(is the O number of this example program. C is set to an abitrary number, however it MUST match the If[]Goto line.)
(The Spindle RPM and Feedrates are defaulted to reasonable numbers, they can be changed by adding S and F variables)
(W is set to .0001 because of a current bug that makes letter spacing kinda bad on arcs.)

(ENGRAVE PART NUMBER AND JOB NUMBER ON BOTH SIDES)

(This is just a typical detail block, it just defines the engraving. It is recommended to place at the very end)
(of your part program. The N# must match the IF[]Goto line at the top of the program. Notice the #100 and #101,)
(They can be changed at the top of the program by the operator to easily adjust the engraving between job changes)
(The Paranthesis's at the end of the detail lines are not mandatory, but it would be good practice to explain at the line)
(is adding to the engraving.)
(I highly recommend using the Engraving Programmer page in the Excel Helper file. It makes creating most detail blocks trivial.)
